# BeefyGoodness
Beef module based off of deployed stager for Eudora mail, sans the eudora mail part (as learned in eCPTX). Typically requires msfvenom to have the modules imported so you can generate a local payload.

Run the .sh (sed out the metasploit3 if you get tired of the alerts) and generate a payload to beef bind on 4444 or w/e, then stage it and run beef bind shellcode through it.
